This build is a beta build, so there could still be some bugs.

To play the game, you need to have windowsBuild_Data, UnityPlayer.dll, and windowsBuild.exe downloaded in the same directory.
Launch the .exe file to start playing.

The full release is on April 17th, 2018.
Our team is still working on the game.
