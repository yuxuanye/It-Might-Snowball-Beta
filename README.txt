This build is a beta build, so there could still be some bugs.

To play the game, you need to have windowsBuild_Data, UnityPlayer.dll, and windowsBuild.exe downloaded in the same directory.
Launch the .exe file to start playing. To close the beta game, press alt+F4 since the "quit" UI isn't functional yet. 
We focused mainly on the gameplay during these two months.

The full release is on April 17th, 2018.
Our team is still working on the game.
Team members: Kevin Etchill, Heming Han, Yuanze Zhang, Yuxuan Ye.
